The problem being addressed using data science is loan default prediction, which involves creating a predictive tool to evaluate the creditworthiness of loan applicants and support lending institutions in making informed decisions. The model aims to enhance risk assessment, improve lending practices, and minimize financial losses associated with loan defaults. Through data science methodologies, the objective is to provide a reliable and data-driven approach to identify high-risk loan applicants, ultimately contributing to sound and responsible lending in the financial sector.# LoanDefaultPrediction
